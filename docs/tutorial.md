## Tutorial

#### Starting Out

Before being able to modify configurations or other data for the bot, you need to run it once so that it can set up all the files it needs. It will not actually connect to Twitch, however, so you can close it after the popup comes up.

#### Finding Your Installation Directory

After running the bot once, it will have set up a directory to store data for the bot. The default installation directory is a folder called `.otbproject` in your home directory. On Windows, you can find your default installation directory by typing `%USERPROFILE%\.otbproject` into the address bar of Windows Explorer (which is the file explorer, and is not the same as Internet Explorer). I assume that if you are on Mac or Linux, you know where your home directory is.

After this point, all paths will be denoted within the `.otbproject` installation directory, and it is assumed that you have already determined that directory's location.

#### Setting Your Account Information
